GH Promotional Generator
========================

Special promotional generator for `Garnet Hill`.<br>
www.garnethill.com

***This tool is to help generate all of the promotional components needed for the short burn and seasonal web specials located at garnethill.com.***


It was developed as a solution to expedite the generation of the `html` code snippets needed for each promotional campaign, with a reduction of human errors associated with building each campaigns special promo elements individually from the ground up for each occurance.


**Elements Needed**
 - Title of the promotion
 - Fineprint specific to the web banners
 - Fineprint specific to the Product Display Page (PDP)
 - Hex code (ie. ff0033) for the color of the promotion
 - Global banner/espot call to action copy
 - Location to link global espot
 - Image path for the large, site-wide promotional banner
 - URL path of the html page for fineprint
 - Image path of the category banner
 - Alt text for all banners


Simply enter the information received into the tool and generate the required components. Once the output has been created you can copy/paste it into an editor of choice to make any additional style changes / link changes / copy changes as needed.

**NOTE**<br>
Elements within this output are *VERY* specific to the server and back-end logic we run on our web site at Garnet Hill. You can use this as a basis for your project, however, the "lightbox" that is generated within the *category* banner is quite specific to the needs of Garnet Hill.

As with everythign on GIT, this is a work in progress. Feel free to offer information/ideas/suggestions on how this tool could be expanded to become a more universal.
